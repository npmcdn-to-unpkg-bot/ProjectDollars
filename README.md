#The Domus Project

- this was drawn from a show I finished watching on netflix. Chances are that show still has a few things left to wrap up, but I wanted to challenge myself on building a site to replicate some of the functions the show presents

- it's an anonymous site for all users except one. the admin. admin are manually created server side and are there to administrate the site.
- you log in with a password and only a password. from there you can make a post, as well as reply and upvote other posts
- it's kind of like twitter, or yik yak, all apps that have been done before, but it only exists on the web.
- mainly just to challenge myself visually to see what i can come up with

Stage One:
- HTML Static pages and content
- Some JS Functionality
- A Ruby on Rails Application deployed to Heroku
